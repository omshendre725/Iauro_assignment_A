          <h3>1. Lexus LC</h3>
          <p>
            Easily one of the best luxury sports cars money can buy, the Lexus LC touts a downright striking, unibody design. Seriously, this top sports car is like a swift shark of wielded steel and aluminium on wheels. Naturally, the interior is no less elegant, with supremely comfortable seats and all sorts of sophisticated details.
          </p>
          <p>Powering the ride is a 471 hp 5.0-litre V8 engine, joined by a 10-speed electronically controlled Direct-Shift transmission with magnesium paddle shifters. If you can afford it, you should buy it.</p>

          <h3>2. Lamborghini Hurac√°n</h3>
          <p>
            ‚ÄúHere I am, rock me like a hurricane!‚Äù sings the Lamborghini Hurac√°n. This sexy, agile beast puts the ‚Äúsuper‚Äù in supercar one spec at a time. The exterior takes design cues from the hexagonal shape of a carbon atom, though one doesn‚Äôt need context in order to appreciate those aerodynamic curves or that low-slung roof.
          </p>
          <p>Under the skin you‚Äôll find a naturally aspirated 5.2 V10 engine and seven-speed dual-clutch automatic. Further distinguishing the vehicle is an array of exterior LED lights that make this baby glow literally and figuratively at all hours of the night.</p>

          <h3>3. Audi R8</h3>
          <p>
            Track-tested and road-approved, the Audi R8 Coupe delivers top shelf performance and jaw-dropping style in equal measure. Featuring about half the same specs as the brand‚Äôs R8 LMS GT3 race car, this is accordingly one powerful, lightweight ride.
          </p>
          <p>The R8‚Äôs naturally aspirated 5.2 V10 engine generates up to 610 hp and 413 ft-lbs of torque, getting the car from 0-62 mph in 3.2 seconds flat. Also featured on the standard model is seven-speed automatic transmission, all-wheel drive and a downright gorgeous interior awash with comfort and technology.</p>

          />
          <h3>4. Jaguar F-TYPE</h3>
          <p>
            Available as a coupe or convertible, the Jaguar F-TYPE is unique in sight and sound alike. Immediately separating this top sports car from the herd is a striking, muscular exterior, and the roar of its advanced petrol engine.
          </p>
          <p>Inside every model you‚Äôll find a Touch Pro 10‚Ä≥ infotainment screen, Jaguar‚Äôs most intuitive to date. Choose between a range of models and power up (or down) accordingly.</p>

          />
          <h3>5. Chevrolet Corvette Z06</h3>
          <p>
            Supremely powerful and wildly acclaimed, the Chevrolet Corvette Z06 is everything that the best sports cars are made of. It was developed in tandem with the C7.R race car and similarly exudes a track-ready vibe. Choose between the coupe and convertible and expect to feel like you‚Äôre flying by way of a supercharged aluminium 6.2-litre V-8 engine.
          </p>
          <p>That engine, by the way, delivers a formidable 650 hp and 650 ft-lbs of torque, getting the car from 0-60 mph in 2.95 seconds. Upgrade to the Z07 Performance package and get all sorts of extra goodies like carbon-ceramic brakes and adjustable aero bits. Serious sports car lovers need not look further.</p>
